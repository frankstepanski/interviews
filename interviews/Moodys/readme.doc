Please complete the below exercises:

Build a page in Code Pen (https://codepen.io/ ) or JS Fiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/ ) based on the attached images. Feel free to use any JS frameworks (React, Angular, etc…) or none. 

1)	How would you expect the data response or contract to look for this grid? (how would you want to see this call coming from the API?)
2)	Style the page matching the images as closely as you can 
-	If a ticket is high priority make the background red 
-	If a ticket is low priority make the background green 
-	If a ticket is neutral priority make the text gray 
3)	Add sorting into the grid
-	By default the ticket column should be sorted in ASC order
-	When a user clicks the column header then the column sorts in DESC order (SYS-0144 is smaller than ASYS-9870 since 0144 is smaller than 9870). If the user clicks the column again it should be sorted in ASC order. 
-	Next to the column that is sorted there should be an indication (^ ascending, v descending)
4)	Load more records 
-	Click “load more” button and more records load into the grid

There is no rush in completing this, feel free to take as much time as you need and include the link to the completed exercises as well as a ReadMe file if needed.
